# Getting Started with R

* Discuss usefulness of R in a data-intense world
* Run-down of RStudio installation
* Inclusion of packages
* Numerical summaries 
* Data visualizations

In any given discipline, from business to academia, there is a need for data analysis. Amongst the most popular tools to analyze data sets is R, a programming language that allows users to easily perform statistical analyses and create data visualizations.

In this article, we're going to use R to do some basic numerical analysis on a dataset. Following this, we'll make some cool visualizations on the same data. If you haven't used R before, no problem! I'll get you set up with the proper software.

# Downloading R and RStudio

If you haven't already downloaded R, you can do so at the following links [for a Mac](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/R-3.2.4.pkg), [for a PC](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.2.4revised-win.exe), and [for various flavors of Linux](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/).

Downloading R is all well and good, but doing significant work with the language is best done using an integrated development environment, or IDE. One of the most popular choices is RStudio, with support for Mac, Windows, Debian, Ubuntu, and Redhat. Downloading is painless: click [this link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), choose the proper download for your system and architecture. After installing, fire RStudio up. You're now ready to begin programming with R!

# Packages

R by itself can do quite a bit, but the real fun comes in with **packages**. Put simply, packages extend the functionality of R to do just about anything users can dream of. Don't believe me? [Check out all 8,153 of them](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).
